# Zelda-Reimagined
This is my take on a Zelda game. You will be placed in a map with various enemies, and the goal is to defeat all the enemies without getting hit. 

## How To Run
- Have python3 and pygame installed
- Run `python main.py`

## Controls
- arrow keys to move
- spacebar to attack
- left shift to boost speed
